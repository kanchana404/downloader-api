"""Per-platform proxy escalation, stored in Redis.

COST RATIONALE - read this before touching the thresholds.

    direct (no proxy)   $0        the only free option
    datacenter proxy    ~$0.50-2 / GB, often a flat monthly pool
    residential proxy   ~$3-10  / GB, metered, and it is metered on BOTH
                                 directions of a video download

A 1080p YouTube video is ~120MB. On residential that is roughly $0.36-1.20 for
ONE download, i.e. ~$180 per 1000 at the top of the range. Escalating a platform
that did not actually need residential - because of one transient 403, or because
somebody hammered a dead URL - is precisely how the monthly bill goes from $20 to
$2,000 without anybody noticing until the invoice lands.

So the ladder is deliberately asymmetric:

  * escalate SLOWLY: three *consecutive* blocked responses. Any success anywhere
    in between resets the counter to zero, so a flaky minute cannot promote a
    platform.
  * de-escalate on a CLOCK, not on a whim: only after 24 hours with no block at
    all do we step down one level. Stepping down eagerly causes a flap
    (down -> blocked -> up -> down) that costs more than staying put, because
    every flap burns a handful of full-price retries.
  * step ONE level at a time in both directions. Jumping none -> residential on
    a burst of 403s is the expensive failure mode.

State lives in one Redis hash per platform at ``proxy_strategy:{platform}`` (the
key name is fixed by the service contract), with fields:

    level          "none" | "datacenter" | "residential"
    fails          consecutive blocked responses at the current level
    last_block_at  unix seconds of the most recent block (drives de-escalation)
    changed_at     unix seconds of the most recent level change (for ops)

A hash rather than several keys because the contract fixes the key namespace, and
because level+counter must be read together to make a decision.
