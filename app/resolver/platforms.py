"""Platform detection and the direct-CDN-handoff policy table.

WHY this module is the economic centre of the service: the single most expensive
decision we make per request is whether bytes flow through our worker. A platform
in ``DIRECT_HANDOFF`` costs roughly $0.10 per 1000 downloads because we only move
a JSON blob; the same platform routed through the worker costs ~$2 per 1000, and
~$180 per 1000 if it needs residential proxies at 1080p. So `direct_handoff` is
not a capability flag, it is a budget flag, and every entry below carries the
reason it was set the way it was.

The rule of thumb behind each decision: a CDN URL is client-fetchable when it is
signed against *time* (or nothing at all). It is NOT client-fetchable when it is
signed against the *requesting IP*, gated on a Referer/Origin header the browser
will not send cross-origin, or only published as segmented HLS/DASH that a
browser cannot save as one file. Those three cases force the worker path.

Detection deliberately requires a URL that points at a specific piece of media.
A bare profile or channel URL must NOT resolve to a platform - it should fall
through to ``unsupported_platform`` (or ``playlist_rejected``) rather than hand
yt-dlp something that expands into hundreds of entries.
